 Project Title: GO Transit Usage and Weather Patterns

 Dataset 1: The first dataset was acquired from Metrolinx (Operator of GO Transit in Toronto) by a group member. The dataset includes the number of boardings at each hour at each GO Train Station in the network from March 2017 to February 2020. To protect confidentiality, Metrolinx multiplied the data entries by a coefficient. Regardless, trends can still be extracted, analyzed and predicted from this dataset.

 Dataset 2: The second dataset is weather data from the Government of Canada (acquired from: https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html). The data consists of daily Toronto weather data such as minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean temperature, percipitation (mm) and snow on the ground (cm).

 Description: We are attempting to find the relation between GO Transit ridership and weather.
 1. How does the mean temperature for the day affect GO ridership?
 2. How does the amount of precipitation affect GO ridership? 
 3. How does the amount of snow on the ground affect GO ridership?
 4. How does the day of the week affect GO ridership?
 5. Are there some GO stations that are affected by temperature/precipitation/snow?
 6. Are there some GO stations less affected by temperature/precipitation/snow?
