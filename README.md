 Project Title: GO Transit Usage and Weather Patterns

 Dataset 1: The first dataset was acquired from Metrolinx (Operator of GO Transit in Toronto) by a group member. The dataset includes the number of boardings at each hour at each GO Train Station in the network from March 2017 to February 2020. To protect confidentiality, Metrolinx multiplied the data entries by a coefficient. Regardless, trends can still be extracted, analyzed and predicted from this dataset.

 Dataset 2: The second dataset is weather data from the Government of Canada (acquired from: https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_e.html). The data consists of daily Toronto weather data such as minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean temperature, percipitation (mm) and snow on the ground (cm).
